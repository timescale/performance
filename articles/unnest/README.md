# PostgreSQL INSERT .. UNNEST benchmark

This directory contains resources for running a benchmark to compare PostgreSQL `INSERT ... VALUES` with `INSERT ... UNNEST` for batch ingestion. It tests the performance at the database level using `pg_stat_statements`.

For a deeper dive into `INSERT .. UNNEST`  and the benchmark results, please refer to the blog post: [Boosting Postgres INSERT Performance by 50% with UNNEST](www.timescale.com/blog/boosting-postgres-insert-performance/).

## Prerequisites

To run this benchmark, youâ€™ll need `pgbench` and a PostgreSQL database with the `pg_stat_statements` extension installed and created. 

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark is inteded to compare the performance of two identical Postgres instances, one with with TimescaleDB SkipScan enabled and one with standard Postgres behavior (the TimescaleDB extension is loaded in both cases). The query focuses on retrieving the latest reading for each unique sensor from a table simulating high-ingest sensor data.

The companion blog used a Timescale Cloud instance with 4CPU and 16GB memory.

### What This Benchmark Runs
pgbench is used to run:

- 1 million rows inserted with `INSERT .. VALUES` and 1000 row batches
- 1 million rows inserted with `INSERT .. VALUES` and 5000 row batches
- 1 million rows inserted with `INSERT .. VALUES` and 10000 row batches
- 1 million rows inserted with `INSERT .. UNNEST` and 1000 row batches
- 1 million rows inserted with `INSERT .. UNNEST` and 5000 row batches
- 1 million rows inserted with `INSERT .. UNNEST` and 10000 row batches


## Running the benchmark

To execute the benchmark, use the following commands:

```bash
export CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://database_to_test"
bash run_benchmark.sh
```

## Benchmark results

The script will output the relevant metrics after running.
